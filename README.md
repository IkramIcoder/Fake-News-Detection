# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP Techniques

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting **fake news articles** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning techniques**. Given the rise in misinformation, especially across social platforms, automatic detection of fake news has become crucial.

Our system classifies news articles as either **real** or **fake** based on their textual content using supervised learning models.
